## Overview <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jvcasillas/hex_stickers/master/stickers/academicWriteR.png' align='right' width='275px' style="padding-left:5px;"/>


This is a package of helper functions that are useful for writing academic 
reports/manuscripts. 
The majority of the functions were written for reporting  statistical analyses, 
but there are also a few functions that were designed for project management 
and document preparation using `papaja`.

## Functions

```{r, results='asis', message=F}
academicWriteR::print_dir_ul(path = "./R")
```
