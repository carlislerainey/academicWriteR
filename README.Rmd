## Overview <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jvcasillas/hex_stickers/master/stickers/academicWriteR.png' align='right' width='275px' style="padding-left:5px;"/>


This is a package of helper functions that are useful for writing academic 
reports/manuscripts. 
The majority of the functions were written for reporting  statistical analyses, 
but there are also a few functions that were designed for project management 
and document preparation using `papaja`.

## Functions

```{r, results='asis', message=F}
academicWriteR::print_dir_ul(path = "./R")
```

## Examples

### Rounding

`academicWriteR` includes a rounding function, `round_pval`, specifically for 
p-values. 
It is precise up to the thousandths column. Anything smaller than 0.001 is 
rounded to 0.001. 
`round_pval` is used in the printing functions.

```{r, round_pval-ex, results='hold', message=F} 
library(academicWriteR)

round_pval(0.03765) 
round_pval(0.0000001)
round_pval(0.07)
```

### Printing functions

The printing functions were made to facilitate reporting statistical models in 
RMarkdown using `papaja`. 
`papaja` comes with it's own printing functions but I found that I am 
constantly tinkering with them to get things to work the way I prefer, thus I 
decided to make my own.

The first is a wrapper around the `round_pval` function: `print_pval`. 

```{r, 'print_pval-ex1', results='hide'} 
print_pval(0.03765, latex = FALSE)
```

`r print_pval(0.03765, latex = FALSE)`. 

P-values are printed exactly unless they are less than 0.001. 
Trailing 0's are deleted. 

```{r, 'print_pval-ex2', results='hide'} 
print_pval(0.0765, latex = FALSE)
```

`r print_pval(0.0765, latex = FALSE)`. 

This function is included in other printing functions. 
Set `latex = TRUE` is the output is LaTeX.

#### `lm()` example

The printing functions are used for reporting the results of statistical 
analyses. There are designed to be used in in-line `knitr` chunks (i.e., 
`` `r
1 + 1` ``) in an RMarkdown document. 
Instead of going in to more detail here, I will just work through and example. 
First, I will fit a linear model with the `lm` function.

```{r, lm-ex, echo=TRUE}
lm_mod1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(lm_mod1)$coef
```

In a typical write-up of the results we might say something like:  

**Miles per gallon varied as a function of `weight` (wt). 
Specifically, a  1-unit increase in weight was associated with a decrease in 
`mpg` of 
`r print_model_params(model = lm_mod1, predictor = 'wt', parameter = 'estimate')`
+/- 
`r print_model_params(model = lm_mod1, predictor = 'wt', parameter = 'std.error')` 
standard errors 
`r print_model_params_p(model = lm_mod1, predictor = "wt", latex = FALSE)`.** 

The aforementioned sentence was written in RMarkdown like this: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Miles per gallon varied as a function of `weight` (wt). Specifically, a 
1-unit increase in weight was associated with a decrease in `mpg` of 
`r print_model_params(model = lm_mod1, predictor = 'wt', parameter = 'estimate')` 
+/- `r print_model_params(model = lm_mod1, predictor = 'wt', parameter = 'std.error')`
standard errors `r print_model_params_p(model = lm_mod1, predictor = "wt", latex = FALSE)`.
```

Here I use two print functions: `print_model_params` and `print_model_params_p`. 
The `_p` variant referes to parenthesis. 
In other words it prints the parameter information that I typically put 
between parenthesis. 
Notice each in-line chunk is given it's own line (more on this below).

#### `lmer()` example

Here is another example using `lme4` objects. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
library(broom.mixed)
lmer_mod0 <- lmer(Reaction ~ 1 + (1|Subject), data = sleepstudy, REML = F)
lmer_mod1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ 1 + Days + (1|Subject), data = sleepstudy, REML = F)
model_comparison <- anova(lmer_mod0, lmer_mod1, test = 'Chisq')
summary(lmer_mod1)$coef
```

And a possible write-up: 

**There was a main effect of days 
`r print_nmc_p(table = model_comparison, model = 'lmer_mod1', latex = FALSE)`. 
Specifically, a change of one day was associated with an increase in reaction 
time of 
`r print_model_params(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = 'Days', parameter = 'estimate')` 
ms +/- 
`r print_model_params(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = 'Days', parameter = 'std.error')` 
standard errors 
`r print_model_params_p(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = "Days", latex = FALSE)`.**

The above paragraph was written as follows: 

```{r, eval=F}
**There was a main effect of days 
`r print_nmc_p(table = model_comparison, model = 'lmer_mod1', latex = FALSE)`. 
Specifically, a change of one day was associated with an increase in reaction 
time of 
`r print_model_params(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = 'Days', parameter = 'estimate')` 
ms +/- 
`r print_model_params(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = 'Days', parameter = 'std.error')` 
standard errors 
`r print_model_params_p(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = "Days", latex = FALSE)`.**
```

If you don't interpret the effect directly in the prose you can print all the 
parameters at once using `print_model_param(model, parameter)`. 

```{r, print-model-param-ex, eval=F}
print_model_param(lm_mod1, "(Intercept)", latex = F)
print_model_param(lmer_mod1, "(Intercept)", latex = F)
```

Ex.  
The intercept differed from 0 `r print_model_param(lm_mod1, "(Intercept)", latex = F)`. 


Ex.  
The intercept differed from 0 `r print_model_param(lmer_mod1, "(Intercept)", latex = F)`. 


#### Models fitted in ```brms```

You can now (v. 0.3) print `brms` model objects using `print_model_param`. 

```{r, brms-ex, cache=TRUE, results='hide', message=F}
library(brms)
brms_mod <- brm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
```

Miles per gallon varied as a function of weight 
`r print_model_param(brms_mod, "wt", latex = FALSE)`.

...which was written as: 

```{r, eval=F}
Miles per gallon varied as a function of weight 
`r print_model_param(brms_mod, "wt", latex = FALSE)`.
```


#### Directory structures

The `print_dir_ul` function will print the files of a given directory as an 
unordered list. 
This function was originally written to improve project management. 
I typically use it in README files to print the files in the current directory.

```{r, 'print_dir_ul-ex'}
print_dir_ul(path = ".")
```

If you set `results='asis'` in the knitr chunk you will get an unordered list 
in markdown/HTML. 

````
```{r, 'print_dir_ul-ex', results='asis'}`r ''`
print_dir_ul(path = ".")
```
````

```{r, 'print_dir_ul-ex1', results='asis', echo=F}
print_dir_ul(path = ".")
```

If you set `nested = TRUE` you can print the directory of your choice and the 
files nested within any subdirectories. 
Additionally, the `remove` argument can be used to exclude files/folders using 
regex.

````
```{r, 'print_dir_ul-ex2'}`r ''`
print_dir_ul(path = ".", nested = TRUE, remove = ".md")
```
````

```{r, 'print_dir_ul-ex2', echo=F}
print_dir_ul(path = ".", nested = TRUE, remove = ".md")
```

## Word count

If your output is a word document, you will probably find this function to be 
of little value. 
However, if your manuscript is knit as a PDF, you have probably discovered 
that there isn't a straightforward way to get a word count, especially in a 
dynamic document.

The `count_words` function will give an approximate count of words in an .Rmd 
document. 
It is not perfect---it is still a work in progress---, but it is pretty good 
if you are careful in how you write. 
The function uses regex to remove knitr code chunks, the standard variety as 
well as in-line code. 
For this reason it is best to keep in-line code chunks on their own line (to 
avoid not counting words that are also on the same line). 
Also, when using comments in RMarkdown (i.e., `<!-- comment -->`) one should 
keep each arrow on its own line. For example,

```
<!--
This is a comment
-->
```

If you write your comments like this: 

```
<!-- this is a comment -->
```

no words will be counted after this point in the document (I am working on 
fixing this). 

```{r, eval=F}
This document contains 
`r count_words("README.Rmd")`
words. 
```

This document contains 
`r academicWriteR::count_words("README.Rmd")`
words.
