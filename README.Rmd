```


## Overview


## Examples

```{r}
library(academicWriteR)
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
library(broom.mixed)
mod1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
mod2 <- lmer(Reaction ~ 1 + Days + (1|Subject), data = sleepstudy,
             REML = FALSE)
```

## Rounding functions

`r round_pval(0.03765)`
`r round_pval(0.0000001)`

## Printing functions

`r print_pval(0.03765, latex = FALSE)`
`r print_pval(0.0000001, latex = FALSE)`

There was an effect of `wt` 
`r print_model_params_p(model = mod1, predictor = "wt", latex = FALSE)`. 

There was an effect of `Days` 
`r print_model_params_p(model = mod2, predictor = "Days", latex = F)`

## Functions

```{r, results='asis'}
print_dir_ul(path = "./R")
```
