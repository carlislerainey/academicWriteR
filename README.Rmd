## Overview

This is a package of helper functions that are useful for writing academic 
reports/manuscripts. The majority of the functions are for reporting 
statistical analysis, but there are also a few functions that were designed 
for project management and document preparation using `papaja`. 

## Functions

```{r, results='asis'}
academicWriteR::print_dir_ul(path = "./R")
```

## Examples

### Rounding

`academicWriteR` includes a rounding function, `round_pval`, specifically for 
p-values. It is precise up to the thousandths column. Anything smaller than 
0.001 is rounded to 0.001. `round_pval` is used in the printing functions. 

```{r, round_pval-ex, results='hold'} 
library(academicWriteR)

round_pval(0.03765) 
round_pval(0.0000001)
round_pval(0.07)
```

### Printing functions

The printing functions were made to facilitate reporting statistical models in 
RMarkdown using `papaja`. `papaja` comes with it's own printing functions but 
I found that I am constantly tinkering with them to get things to work the way 
I prefer, thus I decided to make my own. 

The first is a wrapper around the `round_pval` function: `print_pval`. 

```{r, 'print_pval-ex1', results='hide'} 
print_pval(0.03765, latex = FALSE)
```

`r print_pval(0.03765, latex = FALSE)`. 

If the value is above 0.05 the greater than/less than symbol changes 
appropriately and is maxed at 0.05. 

```{r, 'print_pval-ex2', results='hide'} 
print_pval(0.0765, latex = FALSE)
```

`r print_pval(0.0765, latex = FALSE)`. 

This function is included in other printing functions. Set `latex = TRUE` is 
the output is LaTeX. 

#### `lm()` example

The printing functions are used for reporting the results of statistical 
analyses. There are designed to be used in in-line `knitr` chunks (i.e., 
`` `r
1 + 1` ``) in an RMarkdown document. Instead of going in to more detail here, 
I will just work through and example. First, I will fit a linear model with 
the `lm` function. 

```{r, lm-ex, echo=TRUE}
lm_mod1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(lm_mod1)$coef
```

In a typical write-up of the results we might say something like:  

**Miles per gallon varied as a function of `weight` (wt). Specifically, a 
1-unit increase in weight was associated with a decrease in `mpg` of 
`r print_model_params(model = lm_mod1, predictor = 'wt', parameter = 'estimate')` 
+/- 
`r print_model_params(model = lm_mod1, predictor = 'wt', parameter = 'std.error')` 
standard errors 
`r print_model_params_p(model = lm_mod1, predictor = "wt", latex = FALSE)`.** 

The aforemention sentence was written in RMarkdown like this: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Miles per gallon varied as a function of `weight` (wt). Specifically, a 
1-unit increase in weight was associated with a decrease in `mpg` of 
`r print_model_params(model = lm_mod1, predictor = 'wt', parameter = 'estimate')` 
+/- 
`r print_model_params(model = lm_mod1, predictor = 'wt', parameter = 'std.error')` 
standard errors 
`r print_model_params_p(model = lm_mod1, predictor = "wt", latex = FALSE)`. 
```

Here I use two print functions: `print_model_params` and `print_model_params_p`. 
The `_p` variant referes to parenthesis. In other words it prints the parameter 
information that I typically put between parenthesis. Notice each in-line 
chunk is given it's own line (more on this below). 

#### `lmer()` example

Here is another example using `lme4` objects. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
library(broom.mixed)
lmer_mod0 <- lmer(Reaction ~ 1 + (1|Subject), data = sleepstudy, REML = F)
lmer_mod1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ 1 + Days + (1|Subject), data = sleepstudy, REML = F)
model_comparison <- anova(lmer_mod0, lmer_mod1, test = 'Chisq')
summary(lmer_mod1)$coef
```

And a possible write-up: 

**There was a main effect of days 
`r print_nmc_p(table = model_comparison, model = 'lmer_mod1', latex = FALSE)`. 
Specifically, a change of one day was associated with an increase in reaction 
time of 
`r print_model_params(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = 'Days', parameter = 'estimate')` 
ms +/- 
`r print_model_params(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = 'Days', parameter = 'std.error')` 
standard errors 
`r print_model_params_p(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = "Days", latex = FALSE)`.**

The above paragraph was written as follows: 

```{r, eval=F}
**There was a main effect of days 
`r print_nmc_p(table = model_comparison, model = 'lmer_mod1', latex = FALSE)`. 
Specifically, a change of one day was associated with an increase in reaction 
time of 
`r print_model_params(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = 'Days', parameter = 'estimate')` 
ms +/- 
`r print_model_params(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = 'Days', parameter = 'std.error')` 
standard errors 
`r print_model_params_p(model = lmer_mod1, predictor = "Days", latex = FALSE)`.**
```




## Word count

If your output is a word document, you will probably find this function to be 
of little value. However, if your manuscript is knit as a PDF, you have 
probably discovered that there isn't a non-trivial way to get a wordcount, 
especially in a dynamic document. 

The `count_words` function will give an approximate count of words in an .Rmd 
document. It is not perfect---it is still a work in progress---, but it is 
pretty good if you are careful in how you write. The function uses regex to 
remove knitr code chunks, the standard variety as well as in-line code. For 
this reason it is best to keep in-line code chunks on their own line (to avoid 
not counting words that are also on the same line). Also, when using comments 
in RMarkdown (i.e., `<!-- comment -->`) one should keep each arrow on its own 
line. For example, 

```
<!--
This is a comment
-->
```

If you write your comments like this: 

```
<!-- this is a comment -->
```

no words will be counted after this point in the document (I am working on 
fixing this). 

```{r, eval=F}
This document contains 
`r count_words("README.Rmd")`
words. 
```

This document contains 
`r academicWriteR::count_words("README.Rmd")`
words.
